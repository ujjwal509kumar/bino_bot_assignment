# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables a Next.js application to dynamically create and serve new pages through a REST API. The system allows external services (like bino.bot) to generate branded pages on-demand by specifying a route slug and an ordered list of reusable components with their properties. The application will immediately serve these newly created pages at the specified routes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an external service, I want to create new pages via a POST API endpoint, so that I can dynamically generate branded content pages without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to /api/pages THEN the system SHALL accept a JSON payload containing a route slug and component list
2. WHEN the API receives valid page data THEN the system SHALL create a new page accessible at /{slug}
3. WHEN the page creation is successful THEN the system SHALL return a success response with the new page URL
4. IF the API receives invalid data THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages with HTTP status codes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to use reusable components to build pages, so that I can maintain consistent branding and functionality across all generated pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building pages THEN the system SHALL provide exactly 5 reusable components: Card, ImageBlock, TextSection, StatsBox, and CTA
2. WHEN using the ImageBlock component THEN the system SHALL display images properly with appropriate styling
3. WHEN components are specified in the API payload THEN the system SHALL render them in the exact order provided
4. WHEN component props are provided THEN the system SHALL apply them correctly to each component instance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the API, I want clear documentation and examples, so that I can successfully create pages using the endpoint.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the project README THEN the system SHALL provide sample curl commands for the API endpoint
2. WHEN reviewing documentation THEN the system SHALL include links to pre-created demo pages
3. WHEN examining examples THEN the system SHALL show at least 1-2 working demo pages created via the API

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to access dynamically created pages immediately, so that I can view the content without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a page is successfully created via API THEN the system SHALL make it immediately accessible at /{slug}
2. WHEN accessing a generated page THEN the system SHALL render all specified components with their properties
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display content with proper styling and layout
4. IF a requested slug doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL return a 404 error

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want the application deployed publicly, so that external services can integrate with the API endpoint.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL be accessible via a public URL
2. WHEN accessing the live API THEN the system SHALL accept POST requests to /api/pages from external sources
3. WHEN the deployment is complete THEN the system SHALL provide the live API URL in documentation
4. WHEN using the deployed version THEN the system SHALL maintain the same functionality as the local development version
